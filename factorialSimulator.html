            <h3>What is Factorial ?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In mathematical concept, the end product of given postive(+) integers(n) or number is called as factorial
                of that number which is denoted by "n!". Factorial is also called as the end product of an integer and
                all the integers falling under it. For example : The factorial of Number 3 (3!) is equals to 6 (3 x 2 x
                1= 6). Factorial calculations are occured in many areas of maths just like in case of mathematical
                analysis, algebra, combinatorics etc. Earlier in 12th century 'Indian Scholars' started using the trend
                of factorial calculations for counting permutations. In 1808 one of the well-known french mathematician
                Christian Kramp introduced the notation of 'n!' for factorial. The basic formula for defining the
                factorial function is : n! = 1.2.3...(n-2).(n-1).n i.e for example 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.</p>
